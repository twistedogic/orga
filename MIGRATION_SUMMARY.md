# Migration Summary: Trello → Local BoltDB

## Overview

Successfully migrated the Orga application from Trello API integration to a purely local BoltDB-based system. The application now works completely offline with no external dependencies.

## Changes Made

### 🗑️ **Removed Files**
- `cmd/configure/authorize.go` - Trello authorization logic
- `cmd/configure/configure.go` - Trello API configuration command  
- `cmd/configure/` (entire directory) - No longer needed
- `pkg/config/default.go` - Merged into config.go
- `pkg/config/config_test.go` - Trello-specific configuration tests

### 📝 **Modified Files**

#### `cmd/cli.go`
- Removed configure command import and registration
- Updated app description: "Agile Trello for one" → "Local Kanban board for agile task management"
- Now only contains the `run` command

#### `pkg/config/config.go`
- **Before**: Full config system with Trello API keys, tokens, file I/O
- **After**: Simple package with only `DefaultList` constant
- Removed all Trello-related configuration fields
- Removed JSON serialization/deserialization
- Removed file system operations

#### `README.md`
- Updated title description to emphasize local-only operation
- Removed "Configuration" section (no longer needed)
- Removed Trello API integration from future enhancements
- Added offline-first messaging
- Updated feature list to highlight local storage benefits

#### `demo.md`
- Removed references to Trello API setup
- Updated to reflect local-only operation

#### `go.mod`
- Automatically removed `github.com/pkg/errors` dependency (unused after config simplification)

## Current State

### ✅ **What Still Works**
- Complete TUI Kanban board functionality
- Local BoltDB data persistence
- Multiple boards support
- Card management (create, edit, delete)
- All keyboard navigation features
- Priority-based card sorting

### ✅ **What's Improved**
- **Faster startup**: No network calls or API authentication
- **Offline operation**: Works without internet connection
- **Simplified setup**: No configuration required
- **Reduced dependencies**: Fewer external packages
- **Better security**: No API keys stored locally

### 🎯 **How to Use**

```bash
# Build the application
go build -o orga

# Start the TUI Kanban board (only command needed)
./orga run

# Optional: Specify custom board name and database file
./orga run --board "My Project" --db "project.db"
```

## Architecture Summary

The application now has a clean, simple architecture:

```
orga/
├── cmd/
│   ├── cli.go          # Main CLI app with run command only
│   └── run/            # TUI run command
├── pkg/
│   ├── backend/        # Database abstraction layer
│   │   └── bolt/       # BoltDB implementation
│   ├── config/         # Simple constants (just DefaultList)
│   └── view/           # TUI implementation
└── orga.go             # Main entry point
```

### Key Benefits of Local-Only Approach

1. **No External Dependencies**: Works completely offline
2. **Fast Performance**: No network latency
3. **Privacy**: All data stays local
4. **Simplicity**: No authentication or API configuration
5. **Reliability**: Not dependent on external service availability
6. **Security**: No API keys or tokens to manage

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- BoltDB backend tests ✅
- Application builds without errors ✅
- TUI interface works correctly ✅
- All features function as expected ✅

The migration is complete and the application is now a fully local, offline-capable Kanban board tool.
