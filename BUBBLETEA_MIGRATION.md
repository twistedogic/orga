# Migration Summary: tview → Bubbletea

## Overview

Successfully migrated the Orga TUI implementation from tview to Bubbletea, bringing modern terminal UI architecture and enhanced user experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Why Bubbletea?

### Benefits of Bubbletea over tview:
- **Modern Architecture**: The Elm Architecture (Model-View-Update) pattern
- **Better State Management**: Predictable state updates and immutable data flow
- **Enhanced Styling**: Lipgloss for beautiful, flexible styling
- **Better Form Handling**: Huh library for interactive forms
- **Active Development**: More actively maintained with regular updates
- **Composable Components**: Easier to build and maintain complex UIs
- **Better Testing**: Easier to test with clear separation of concerns

## Technical Changes

### 🔄 **Architecture Migration**

#### Before (tview):
- Event-driven with callbacks
- Mutable state management
- Component-based UI construction
- Direct event handling

#### After (Bubbletea):
- Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern
- Immutable state updates
- Functional approach to UI rendering
- Message-based communication

### 📦 **Dependencies**

#### Removed:
- `github.com/rivo/tview`
- `github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2` (direct dependency)

#### Added:
- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` - Core framework
- `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss` - Styling and layout
- `github.com/charmbracelet/huh` - Form handling
- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles` - Reusable components (auto-added)

### 🏗️ **Code Structure Changes**

#### `pkg/view/view.go` - Complete Rewrite:

**Before (tview):**
```go
type View struct {
    context.Context
    *tview.Application
    *backend.Board
    grid       *tview.Grid
    listViews  []*tview.List
    currentCol int
    footer     *tview.TextView
}
```

**After (Bubbletea):**
```go
type Model struct {
    ctx        context.Context
    board      *backend.Board
    lists      []*backend.List
    cards      map[string][]*backend.Card
    currentCol int
    currentRow int
    state      State
    width      int
    height     int
    cardForm   *huh.Form
    // ... other fields
}
```

### 🎨 **Styling Improvements**

#### Before (tview):
- Basic border styling
- Limited color options
- Fixed layout constraints

#### After (Bubbletea + Lipgloss):
- Rich styling with Lipgloss
- Customizable colors and borders
- Flexible layout system
- Responsive design

### 🖼️ **Visual Enhancements**

1. **Better Card Display**:
   - Rounded borders for cards
   - Color-coded value/effort indicators
   - Improved spacing and padding

2. **Enhanced Navigation**:
   - Clear visual indicators for selected list/card
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - Better contrast and readability

3. **Modern Forms**:
   - Interactive form fields with validation
   - Better error handling and user feedback
   - Keyboard navigation within forms

### 🔧 **Functional Improvements**

#### Navigation:
- **Before**: Basic arrow key navigation
- **After**: Support for both arrow keys and vim-style navigation (hjkl)

#### Forms:
- **Before**: Basic tview forms
- **After**: Modern Huh forms with validation and better UX

#### State Management:
- **Before**: Mutable state with callbacks
- **After**: Immutable state with message passing

## Implementation Details

### State Management

#### States:
```go
type State int
const (
    StateBoard State = iota
    StateCardForm
    StateConfirmDelete
)
```

#### Message Handling:
```go
func (m *Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
    case tea.WindowSizeMsg:
        m.width = msg.Width
        m.height = msg.Height
    case tea.KeyMsg:
        switch m.state {
        case StateBoard:
            return m.handleBoardKeys(msg)
        case StateCardForm:
            return m.handleFormKeys(msg)
        case StateConfirmDelete:
            return m.handleConfirmKeys(msg)
        }
    }
    return m, nil
}
```

### Enhanced Keyboard Controls

#### Board Navigation:
- `←/h`: Move left between lists
- `→/l`: Move right between lists  
- `↑/k`: Move up between cards
- `↓/j`: Move down between cards
- `n`: New card
- `Enter`: Edit card
- `d`: Delete card
- `r`: Refresh
- `q/Ctrl+C`: Quit

#### Form Navigation:
- `Tab`: Next field
- `Shift+Tab`: Previous field
- `Enter`: Submit form
- `Esc`: Cancel

### Styling System

#### Color Scheme:
- Primary: Blue (#0066CC)
- Success: Green (#00AA00)
- Warning: Yellow (#FFAA00)
- Error: Red (#CC0000)
- Muted: Gray (#666666)

#### Layout:
- Responsive column widths
- Proper padding and margins
- Rounded borders for cards
- Clean typography
